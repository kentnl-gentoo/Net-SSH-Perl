Add more tests to the test suite; add SSH2 tests.

Fixes to SSH2 implementation:
    * get rid of dummy shell channel (if possible)
    * more documentation
    * anything currently marked XXX in the code

Compatibility with NetScreen?

Use non-blocking connect, like IO::Socket, to implement a
connect Timeout.

A proper scp client.

Port forwarding.
